                    BORED APE YACHT CLUB</h1>
                <p>BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs—unique digital <br>collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Bored Ape <br>doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants <br> access to members-only benefits, the first of which is access to<br> THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board. Future areas <br>and perks can be unlocked by the community through <br> roadmap activation.</p>

                <h1><b>THE SPECS</b></h1>
                <p>Each Bored Ape is unique and programmatically generated from over 170 <br> possible traits, including expression, headwear, clothing, and more. All apes <br> are dope, but some are rarer than others.
                <br><br>
                The apes are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and <br> hosted on IPFS. (See Record and Proof.) Purchasing an ape costs 0.08 ETH.
            <br><br>
            To access members-only areas such as THE BATHROOM , Apeholders will  <br>need to be signed into their Metamask Wallet.</p>

        <h1><b>THE BATHROOM</b></h1>
        <p>The BAYC Bathroom will become operational once the presale period is over. It <br> contains a canvas accessible only to wallets containing at least one ape. Like <br> any good dive bar bathroom, this is the place to draw, scrawl, or write <br>expletives.
        <br><br>
        Each ape-holder will be able to paint a pixel on the bathroom wall every fifteen <br>minutes. Think of it as a collaborative art experiment for the cryptosphere. A <br>members-only canvas for the discerning minds of crypto twitter.
    <br><br>
    We're pretty sure it's going to be full of dicks.</p>
